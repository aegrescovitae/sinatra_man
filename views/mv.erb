     mv -- move files

SYNOPSIS
     mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source target
     mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source ... directory

DESCRIPTION
     In its first form, the mv utility renames the file named by the source operand to the destination path
     named by the target operand.  This form is assumed when the last operand does not name an already
     existing directory.

     In its second form, mv moves each file named by a source operand to a destination file in the existing
     directory named by the directory operand.  The destination path for each operand is the pathname pro-duced produced
     duced by the concatenation of the last operand, a slash, and the final pathname component of the named
     file.

     The following options are available:

     -f      Do not prompt for confirmation before overwriting the destination path.  (The -f option over-rides overrides
             rides any previous -i or -n options.)

     -i      Cause mv to write a prompt to standard error before moving a file that would overwrite an
             existing file.  If the response from the standard input begins with the character `y' or `Y',
             the move is attempted.  (The -i option overrides any previous -f or -n options.)

     -n      Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The -n option overrides any previous -f or -i options.)

     -v      Cause mv to be verbose, showing files after they are moved.

     It is an error for either the source operand or the destination path to specify a directory unless both
     do.

     If the destination path does not have a mode which permits writing, mv prompts the user for confirma-tion confirmation
     tion as specified for the -i option.

     As the rename(2) call does not work across file systems, mv uses cp(1) and rm(1) to accomplish the
     move.  The effect is equivalent to:

           rm -f destination_path && \
           cp -pRP source_file destination && \
           rm -rf source_file</p>
