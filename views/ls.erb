  NAME
     ls -- list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls displays its name as well as any
     requested, associated information.  For each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays
     the names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed.  If more than one oper-and operand
     and is given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are
     sorted separately and in lexicographical order.

     The following options are available:

     -@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes in long (-l) output.

     -1      (The numeric digit ``one''.)  Force output to be one entry per line.  This is the default when
             output is not to a terminal.

     -A      List all entries except for . and ...  Always set for the super-user.

     -a      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).

     -B      Force printing of non-printable characters (as defined by ctype(3) and current locale settings)
             in file names as \xxx, where xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.

     -b      As -B, but use C escape codes whenever possible.

     -C      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to a terminal.

     -c      Use time when file status was last changed for sorting (-t) or long printing (-l).

     -d      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).

     -e      Print the Access Control List (ACL) associated with the file, if present, in long (-l) output.

     -F      Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an asterisk (`*')
             after each that is executable, an at sign (`@') after each symbolic link, an equals sign (`=')
             after each socket, a percent sign (`%') after each whiteout, and a vertical bar (`|') after
             each that is a FIFO.

     -f      Output is not sorted.  This option turns on the -a option.

     -G      Enable colorized output.  This option is equivalent to defining CLICOLOR in the environment.
             (See below.)

     -g      This option is only available for compatibility with POSIX; it is used to display the group
             name in the long (-l) format output (the owner name is suppressed).

     -H      Symbolic links on the command line are followed.  This option is assumed if none of the -F, -d,
             or -l options are specified.

     -h      When used with the -l option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte
             and Petabyte in order to reduce the number of digits to three or less using base 2 for sizes.

     -i      For each file, print the file's file serial number (inode number).

     -k      If the -s option is specified, print the file size allocation in kilobytes, not blocks.  This
             option overrides the environment variable BLOCKSIZE.

     -L      Follow all symbolic links to final target and list the file or directory the link references
             rather than the link itself.  This option cancels the -P option.

     -l      (The lowercase letter ``ell''.)  List in long format.  (See below.)  If the output is to a ter-minal, terminal,
             minal, a total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.

     -m      Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by commas.

     -n      Display user and group IDs numerically, rather than converting to a user or group name in a
             long (-l) output.  This option turns on the -l option.

     -O      Include the file flags in a long (-l) output.

     -o      List in long format, but omit the group id.

     -P      If argument is a symbolic link, list the link itself rather than the object the link refer-ences. references.
             ences.  This option cancels the -H and -L options.

     -p      Write a slash (`/') after each filename if that file is a directory.

     -q      Force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as the character `?'; this is the
             default when output is to a terminal.

     -R      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

     -r      Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical order or the oldest entries first
             (or largest files last, if combined with sort by size

     -S      Sort files by size

     -s      Display the number of file system blocks actually used by each file, in units of 512 bytes,
             where partial units are rounded up to the next integer value.  If the output is to a terminal,
             a total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line before the listing.  The environment
             variable BLOCKSIZE overrides the unit size of 512 bytes.

     -T      When used with the -l (lowercase letter ``ell'') option, display complete time information for
             the file, including month, day, hour, minute, second, and year.

     -t      Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexico-graphical lexicographical
             graphical order.

     -u      Use time of last access, instead of last modification of the file for sorting (-t) or long
             printing (-l).

     -U      Use time of file creation, instead of last modification for sorting (-t) or long output (-l).

     -v      Force unedited printing of non-graphic characters; this is the default when output is not to a
             terminal.

     -W      Display whiteouts when scanning directories.  (-S) flag).

     -w      Force raw printing of non-printable characters.  This is the default when output is not to a
             terminal.

     -x      The same as -C, except that the multi-column output is produced with entries sorted across,
             rather than down, the columns.

     The -1, -C, -x, and -l options all override each other; the last one specified determines the format
     used.

     The -c and -u options override each other; the last one specified determines the file time used.

     The -B, -b, -w, and -q options all override each other; the last one specified determines the format
     used for non-printable characters.

     The -H, -L and -P options all override each other (either partially or fully); they are applied in the
     order specified.

     By default, ls lists one entry per line to standard output; the exceptions are to terminals or when the
     -C or -x options are specified.

     File information is displayed with one or more <blank>s separating the information associated with the
     -i, -s, and -l options.

   The Long Format
     If the -l option is given, the following information is displayed for each file: file mode, number of
     links, owner name, group name, number of bytes in the file, abbreviated month, day-of-month file was
     last modified, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and the pathname.  In addition, for
     each directory whose contents are displayed, the total number of 512-byte blocks used by the files in
     the directory is displayed on a line by itself, immediately before the information for the files in the
     directory.  If the file or directory has extended attributes, the permissions field printed by the -l
     option is followed by a '@' character.  Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended security
     information (such as an access control list), the permissions field printed by the -l option is fol-lowed followed
     lowed by a '+' character.

     If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or future, then the year of the
     last modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute fields.

     If the owner or group names are not a known user or group name, or the -n option is given, the numeric
     ID's are displayed.

     If the file is a character special or block special file, the major and minor device numbers for the
     file are displayed in the size field.  If the file is a symbolic link, the pathname of the linked-to
     file is preceded by ``->''.

     The file mode printed under the -l option consists of the entry type, owner permissions, and group per-missions. permissions.
     missions.  The entry type character describes the type of file, as follows:

           b     Block special file.
           c     Character special file.
           d     Directory.
           l     Symbolic link.
           s     Socket link.
           p     FIFO.
           -     Regular file.

     The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group permissions, and other per-missions. permissions.
     missions.  Each field has three character positions:

           1.   If r, the file is readable; if -, it is not readable.

           2.   If w, the file is writable; if -, it is not writable.

           3.   The first of the following that applies:

                      S     If in the owner permissions, the file is not executable and set-user-ID mode is
                            set.  If in the group permissions, the file is not executable and set-group-ID
                            mode is set.

                      s     If in the owner permissions, the file is executable and set-user-ID mode is set.
                            If in the group permissions, the file is executable and setgroup-ID mode is set.

                      x     The file is executable or the directory is searchable.

                      -     The file is neither readable, writable, executable, nor set-user-ID nor set-group-ID setgroup-ID
                            group-ID mode, nor sticky.  (See below.)

                These next two apply only to the third character in the last group (other permissions).

                      T     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), but not execute or search permission.  (See
                            chmod(1) or sticky(8).)

                      t     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), and is searchable or executable.  (See
                            chmod(1) or sticky(8).)
